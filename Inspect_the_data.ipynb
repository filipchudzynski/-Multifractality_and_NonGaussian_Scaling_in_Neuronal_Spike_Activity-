        "4-shank or 8-shank silicon probe in layer CA1 of the right dorsal hippocampus. The\n",
        "individual silicon probes were attached to respective micromanipulators and moved\n",
        "independently. Each shank had 8 recording sites (160 μm2 each site; 1-3 MΩ impedance).\n",
        "These recordings sites were staggered to provide a two-dimensional arrangement (20 μm\n",
        "vertical separation; Fujisawa et al., 2008). The shanks were aligned parallel to the septo-\n",

        "electrodes during recordings. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal\n",
        "Care and Use Committee of Rutgers University.\n",
        "2. Behavioral testing\n",
        "After recovery from surgery (~1 week), physiological signals were recorded during the\n",
        "open field task in which the rats chased randomly dispersed drops of water or pieces of\n",
        "Froot Loops (~25 mg) on an elevated square platform (180 cm x 180 cm, or 120 cm x 120\n",
        "cm). The animals were trained on the platform at least 3 days before the recordings.\n",
        "3. Data collection and analysis\n",
        "During the recording sessions, neurophysiological signals were amplified (1,000X),\n",
        "bandpass-filtered (1 Hz – 5kHz) and acquired continuously at 20 kHz on a 128-channel\n",
        "DataMax system (16-bit resolution; RC Electronics, .dat file). After recording, local field\n",
        "potential (LFP) was down-sampled to 1250 Hz for additional analysis (.eeg file).\n",
        "For offline spike sorting, the wideband signals were digitally high-pass filtered (0.8-5\n",
        "kHz) and the waveforms were re-sampled (Csicsvari et al., 1999). Neurophysiological and\n",
        "behavioral data were explored using NeuroScope (http://neuroscope.sourceforge.net;\n",
        "Hazan et al., 2006). Spike sorting was performed automatically, using KlustaKwik\n",
        "(http://klustawik.sourceforge.net), followed by manual adjustment of the clusters (using\n",
        "“Klusters” software package; http://klusters.sourceforge.net).\n",
        "Each experiment dataset consists of:\n",
        "  * Binary raw data file(s) (FileBase.dat) and binary LFP signal (FileBase.eeg) the binary\n",
        "  file format is as follows: each sample is stored as type short integer (2 bytes) in the\n",
        "  order Channel_1:Sample_1, Channel_2:Sample_1, ..., Channel_N:Sample_1,\n",
        "  Channel_1:Sample_2, Channel_2:Sample_2, ... etc. The number of channels is not\n",
        "  always a multiple of 8 (eight recording sites per shank) because bad channels (due to\n",
        "  very high impedance or broken shank) were removed from the data.\n",
        "  * For each shank/electrode N there are several files containing the information about\n",
        "  spikes extracted from this electrode:\n",
        "    * Text file of spike time stamps (FileBase.res.N, where N – shank index). The time\n",

        "    * Text file of cluster identities (FileBase.clu.N). The first number – total number of\n",
        "  clusters, where cluster with index 0 represents artifacts, 1 – noise/nonclusterable\n",
        "  units, 2 and above – isolated units.\n",
        "    * Spikes recorded in multiple sessions on the same day were sorted together and the\n",
        "  same cell ID numbers were assigned in the sessions.\n",
        "  Example: In sessions ec013.527, ec013.528 and ec013.529, a given cell has the\n",
        "  same cell ID in the .clu files in all three sessions, as they were clustered together.\n",
